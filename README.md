The importance of identifying design properties of a mock up design

üîë 1. Clarifies Design Intent
Mockups showcase layout, color, typography, spacing, and element positions‚Äîmaking it easier for developers, clients, and team members to understand exactly what the designer envisions.

üß© 2. Ensures Consistency Across Platforms
Defining design properties (like font sizes, colors, and button styles) helps maintain a consistent look and feel across different pages, devices, or platforms.

üñºÔ∏è 3. Guides Development Accurately
When design properties are clearly identified, developers can translate the mockup into code without guesswork, reducing the risk of mismatches between design and implementation.

üîç 4. Supports Usability & Accessibility
Design choices like contrast ratios, font legibility, and spacing directly impact user experience. Identifying these early ensures the product is usable and accessible to all users.

üìä 5. Speeds Up Feedback & Iteration
With clearly defined properties, stakeholders can provide more targeted feedback. This speeds up the design iteration process and helps avoid vague comments like ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt look right.‚Äù
